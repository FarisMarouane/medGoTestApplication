In order for the entire app to work, I connected the client side (built with react) to the back-end in the package.json file inside of the client folder (It is the line: "proxy": "http://localhost:1337").

Therefore, in order for everything to work, the back-end server needs to be running on port 1337.
Or if you want to use another port, make sure that you change it in the package.json file inside of the client folder.
