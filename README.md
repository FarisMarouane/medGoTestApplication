# Welcome

This template uses Sails (http://sailsjs.com/) and ReactJs (https://reactjs.org/) stacks. It is intended as a project starter for testing:
- [x] your motivation for joining an awesome startup :)
- [x] your competence (either you master react and sails) or your ability to learn new technologies (or you don't)
- [x] your code quality
- [x] your sense of UX/UI

### What you should do
You must implement a form so that a user can contact the webmaster. The info must conform to the model ContactInfo.js. To help you, we wrote "YOUR CODE GOES HERE" so you know where to start. But you are welcome to add new files, import a npm library, or do whatever you want to achieve a beautiful and efficient result.

You are welcomed to comment your code and make a beautiful responsive website.

### How to do it
You can clone this project and create a new branch which should be named after you.
Once you are finished, you can push your branch on Github and send an email to chris@medgo.fr

# Good luck !
